Say you have this bit of HTML:


<p>I am a paragraph of text that has a few words in it.</p>
Then you write this CSS for it:


p {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid;
}
The content would break out of your element and it would be 142px wide, rather than 100px. Why is that? The box model is a core foundation of CSS and understanding how it works, how it is affected by other aspects of CSS and importantly, how you can control it will help you to write more predictable CSS.
